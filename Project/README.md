<h1>Image Generation</h1>
The code of the DCGAN model for Cifar-10 and MNIST dataset is written in the
files.

Run the cell to start the training process and the models get saved
after every epoch (You can modify the code to save the model at a few epochs
if needed).

In a different section, a code has been written to take the pre-trained model as input and produce images as output. This code enables the user to generate the images using the pre-trained model.

<h3>Additional Feature:</h3> 
The generator for DCGAN can have more layers for testing the CNN layers are commented if the 
the user wishes they can increase the layers by uncommenting the layers and for each addition downsample
'h' and 'w' by 2.

The pre-trained models have been attached in the following links :
